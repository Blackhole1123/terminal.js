# terminal.js
Terminal.js is a lightweight, easy to use terminal interface for the web. (Note: This does not actually _run_ Javascript code)
Currently, terminal.js has only been tested on HTML, but I may add support for other platforms in the future.

# Installation
Manually add the CSS and JS files to your project (make sure to also make a fake window in html to "host" the commands in) (Example in code)  
or ```npm i @blackhole1123/terminal.js```

# Usage
Check the Wiki for more details
